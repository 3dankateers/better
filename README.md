<h1>Mission Statement:</h1>
We want to make the league of legends community into a more inclusive and tolerant place. How many of our brethren have found themself in a situation where they got accused of trolling because of champion picks that do not conform to the zeitgeist. We have a solution. We are planning on writing a automatic tool that uses statistics and machine learning to determine what champion pick will best complement the team. We feel taking our reccomendations into consideration will fill the user with pride and accomplishment.

For this purpose, we require the use of an API key so we can build up a dataset of solo-queue games from which we can learn to give the most disruptive reccomendations
